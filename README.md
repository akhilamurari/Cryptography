# Cryptography
Cryptography means the art of writing or solving codes.
The art of protecting information by transforming it (encrypting it) into an unreadable format, called cipher text. Only those who
possess a secret key can decipher (or decrypt) the message into plain text.
There are many techniques caesar cipher is one among them and it is simplest among all ciphers.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. 
For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C and so on.
